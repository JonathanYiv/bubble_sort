# Bubble Sort Project

This is my version of implementing the [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/bubble_sort.git
$ cd bubble_sort
$ ruby bubble_sort.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

No particular thoughts.

## Post-Project Thoughts
At some point, I will read about all the different type of sorting methodologies and their efficiency levels.
Apparently bubble sort is one of the least efficient, except in the case of a short nearly sorted group.
